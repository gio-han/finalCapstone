# Capstone Project - Natural Language Processing (NLP) Applications

The Python program in this repository performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of product reviews.

The dataset used by the program is the CSV file named 'amazon_product_reviews.csv' in the same repository.

The program contains three functions:
* A function that reads CSV files and includes proper error handling.
* A function that that preprocesses single text reviews.
* A function hat takes a product review as input and predicts its sentiment.

In the Python script, the model is then tested on a sample of product reviews.
Lastly, the similarity of two product reviews is compared.

The repository also contains a brief report/summary in a PDF file on the following:
* A description of the dataset used.
* Details of the preprocessing steps.
* An evaluation of results.
* Insights into the model's strengths and limitations.
